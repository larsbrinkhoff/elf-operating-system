PDP-11 operating system by David Retz et al.  First developed at the
Speech Communication Research Laboratory (SCRL), later also
Information Sciences Institute (ISI) and Stanford Research Institute
(SRI).  The files found here are from the Stanford Artificial
Intelligence Laboratory (SU-AI, or SAIL).

ELF was popular on ARPANET, as a small host or a front end to a
mainframe.

The SAIL files have been converted from PDP-10 36-bit words to ASCII
text octets.  Since the PDP-10 stores five 7-bit characters per word,
the one additional bit is placed in the fifth octet.  Some text files
have line numbers and NUL padding between pages.
